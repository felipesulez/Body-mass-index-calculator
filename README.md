Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator
BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI calculator app built using the Kivy framework in Python. The app allows users to input their personal information such as name, surname, high school, height, and weight, and then calculates their BMI based on these inputs.

How to Use
Enter your surname.
Enter your name.
Enter the name of your high school.
Enter your height in centimeters.
Enter your weight in kilograms.
Click the "Submit" button.
The app will then process your input and provide you with the following information:

Your entered values, including surname, name, high school, height, and weight.
Your calculated BMI (Body Mass Index).
Features
Input validation to ensure that only valid numerical values are entered for height and weight.
Robust validation to prevent integers from being entered as names or high school names.
BMI calculation based on the entered height and weight.
A secondary screen that displays the entered values and BMI result with a BMI status (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity).
